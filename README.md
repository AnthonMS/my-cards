# slider-card

## Update Notes

I have cleaned up a tonne in the project files and structure.

The original my-slider will not get anymore updates. If you don't feel like updating to the my-slider-v2, then I would suggest just taking the my-slider.js script from dist dir and importing it manually. Then there won't be any problems with updates breaking your setups.

The my-slider-v2 is essentially a complete rewrite of the slider. It does not rely upon the html range input slider. I have custom coded it from scratch. And so far it seems to work as expected. There will be some documentation for it soon. Just know, this card will now support templating exactly like the custom button card. So no more janky 'color-on' and 'color-off' variables. You can just figure that out yourself with templating now.

I am also working on a my-button card which will be able to handle lights and covers to begin with and it will utilise the new slider-v2 for brightness and cover state.

Hopefully some of you find these updates as exciting as I do. I'm looking forward to using the cards and using them a lot easier.
